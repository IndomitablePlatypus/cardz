# CARDZ

This repo is an attempt to style a "Bonus Cards API" with the DDD approach using bare bones of Laravel.

There are some stipulations we're trying to uphold:
- isolate the project code from the Laravel framework as much as possible;
- isolate the domain as much as possible;
- construct a modular monolith in such a way to make the future transition to the microservice architecture relatively painless;
- try to keep code complexity under control;
- demonstrate most of the major strategic and tactic DDD patterns somewhat to the detriment of the previous consideration;
- demonstrate the implementation of the CQRS pattern, Event Sourcing (with event storage) pattern, ABAC Auth and some other interesting approaches, once again to the probable detriment of the code simplicity;
- provide the bare minimum of tests required to keep a decent level of maintainability.

## Installation instructions

- clone the [repo](https://github.com/IndomitablePlatypus/cardz/) with `git clone`;
- ensure you have **PHP 8.0+**;
- run `composer install`;
- copy `.env.example` to `.env`;
- provide your app key with `php artisan key:generate`;
- make sure you have **PostgreSQL** installed and running;
- create a relevant database and provide credentials for the DB connection in your `.env` file;
- run migrations for your DB with the `php artisan migrate` command; 
- launch `php artisan serve` and proceed to the provided localhost page to take a look at the project API documentation.

Optionally, you can run `php artisan tests` to take a look at a small assortment of included tests.

## Domain description

Some café owners got together and decided that they need a new way to attract more customers.
One such way would be to implement a loyalty program where each customer is given some card with the predefined requirements for a bonus.
When the requirements are met the card owner becomes eligible for the bonus.
Requirements are generally in the line of buying some specific type of coffee or food.
For example, a bonus scheme may be described as "_Buy eight cups of espresso and get a cappuccino for free_" or "_Buy latte, mocha, and cappuccino and get a free lungo_".
Each time the requirement is met it's marked on the card as an achievement.

Once the bonus is received the card lifecycle is completed, and it should be treated as irrelevant.

Requirements can wary for each café and a bonus plan.
The system should mostly keep records of what is or should be done rather than try to control or limit the café owners and managers.

Each owner can establish an unlimited* number of workspaces where they can create an unlimited* number of bonus plans.
A plan is basically a description of requirements (which number, you've guessed it, is unlimited*) and a bonus in free form.

There's no need to be formal, so no proof of ownership or whatever is required.
Basically, every registered user can start a workspace.

Once a workspace is established its keeper can invite more people to work there. Generally, that would be servers, baristas, bartenders, and so on.

Only the collaborators of the same workspace can introduce the changes to the plans, create the new ones, and launch them. New collaborators can be invited only by the keeper.

A customer identifies themselves via the mobile app after which they can be issued a card for the specific plan.
There are no restrictions* on the number of cards a customer can own for each plan or a workspace.
Remember, that we're trying to keep things simple and flexible for a large variety of owners and businesses.

___
*unlimited - within reasonable limits, but that's not in the sphere of our current considerations. 



## Ubiquitous language
### Terms
After some back and forth between the owners the following terms were coined for the domain:
- **customer** - any system user
- **workspace** - a place where some business is conducted, be it a café, a restaurant, or a gift shop. There are no support for the chains and franchises, each individual place is considered to be a separate workspace.
- **keeper** - a person who has created a workspace.
- **collaborator** - a person who has accepted an invitation to work in a workspace.
- **plan** - some kind of bonus program 
- **requirement** - a description of the prerequisite required to receive a bonus
- **card** - a place to track customer's progress towards a bonus obtainment 
- **achievement** - a completed requirement marked in a card

### Contexts
There are four Core contexts: **Cards**, **Personal**, **Plans** and **Workspaces**, two Support ones: **Collaboration** and **MobileAppGateway**, and two Generic ones: **Authorization** and **Identity**.
MobileAppGateway is not, strictly speaking, a context, more of a gateway, but can be considered as such.
Authorization is based on an extremely simple ABAC-like engine designed to serve as a demo for the generic authorization usage in a DDD project with eventually consistent intercontext communication.  
Identity is just a wrap on Laravel Sanctum.

## Further work
- we need to provide more documentation on the thought process and its implementation in the code;
- more context-specific docs are required for each module;
- tests need to be refactored for more clarity and ease of reading.
