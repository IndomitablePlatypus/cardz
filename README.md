# CARDZ

An attempt to style generic Bonus Cards API  with the DDD approach using Laravel.

There are some stipulations we're trying to uphold:
- isolate the project code from the Laravel framework as much as possible;
- isolate the domain as much as possible;
- construct a modular monolith in such a way to make the future transition to microservices relatively painless;
- try to keep code complexity under control;
- demonstrate most of the major strategic and tactic DDD patterns somewhat to the detriment of the previous consideration;
- demonstrate the implementation of the CQRS pattern, Event Sourcing (with event storage) pattern, ABAC Auth and some other interesting approaches once again to the probable detriment of the code simplicity;
- provide the bare minimum of tests required to keep a decent level of maintainability.

## Installation instructions

- clone the [repo](https://github.com/IndomitablePlatypus/cardz/) with `git clone`;
- ensure you have **PHP 8.0+**;
- run `composer install`;
- copy `.env.example` to `.env`;
- provide your app key with `php artisan key:generate`;
- make sure you have **PostgreSQL** installed and running;
- create a relevant database and provide credentials for the DB connection in your `.env` file;
- launch `php artisan serve` and proceed to the provided localhost page to take a look at the project API documentation.

Optionally, you can run `php artisan tests` to take a look at a small assortment of included tests.

## Domain description

Some café owners got together and decided that they need new ways to attract more customers.
One such way would be to implement a loyalty program where each customer is given a card with the predefined requirements and a bonus.
When the requirements are met the customer is eligible for the bonus.
Requirements are generally in the line of buying some specific type of coffee or food.
For example, a card scheme can be described as "Buy eight cups of espresso and get a cappuccino for free" or "Buy latte, mocha, and cappuccino and get a free lungo".
Each time the requirement is met it's marked on the customer card as an achievement.

Once the bonus is received the card lifecycle is completed.

Requirements can wary for each café and a bonus plan.

Each owner can establish an unlimited number of workspaces where they can create an unlimited number of bonus plans.
A plan is basically a description of requirements and a bonus in free form.

There's no need to be formal, so no proof of ownership or whatever is required.
Basically, every registered user can start a workspace.

Once a workspace is established its keeper can invite more people to work there. Generally, that would be servers, baristas, bartenders, and so on.

Only the collaborators of the same workspace can introduce the changes to the plans, create the new ones and launch them. New collaborators can be invited only by the keeper.

A customer identifies themselves via the mobile app after which can be issued a card for the specific plan.
There are no restrictions on the number of cards for a customer and a plan or a customer and a workspace.
Remember, that we're trying to keep things simple and available for a large variety of owners.

## Ubiquitous language
### Terms
After some back and forth between the owners the following terms were coined for the domain:
- **customer**
- **workspace**
- **keeper**
- **collaborator**
- **plan**
- **requirement**
- **card**
- **achievement**

### Contexts
There are four Core contexts: **Cards**, **Personal**, **Plans** and **Workspaces**, two Support ones: **Collaboration** and **MobileAppGateway**, and two Generic ones: **Authorization** and **Identity**.
MobileAppGateway is not, strictly speaking, a context, more of a gateway, but can be considered as such.
Authorization is based on an extremely simple ABAC-like engine designed to serve as a demo for the generic authorization usage in a DDD project with eventually consistent intercontext communication.  
Identity is just a wrap on Laravel Sanctum.

## Further work
- we need to provide more documentation on the thought process and its implementation in the code;
- more context-specific docs are required for each module;
- tests need to be refactored for more clarity and ease of reading.
